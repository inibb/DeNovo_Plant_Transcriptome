# DeNovo Plant Transcriptome Assembly
Building transcriptome assemblies in the absence of a reference genome is as difficult as it sounds. Luckily, technology is always improving, making it possible!

This repository contains two different pipelines to construct transcriptome assemblies _de novo_ that were written as part of my work as a PhD candidate within LettuceKnow consortium. Originally meant to be used for plant transcriptome assembly of mostly homozygous individuals, these can in theory be employed for any other type of organism, although some changes may be required in some steps (willing to adjust it to whatever case!)
